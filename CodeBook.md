#Output.txt has 180 rows and 81 columns

##The following are the 180 row description(s)
	- There are six unique activities, and 30 participants. Hence there are 6*30 = 180 rows



##The following are the 81 column descriptions

"Participants" 
	- indicates participant ID
"Activity" 
	- indicates type of activity performed by a particular participant

[Below are the 79 MEAN measurements with 'mean' or 'sd' for each partipant for each activity.]
